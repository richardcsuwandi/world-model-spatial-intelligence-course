## What is this

"World Model" is becoming the central concept connecting representation learning, generative models, reinforcement learning, and robotics; "Spatial Intelligence" is the key capability that brings it into the physical world. Yet no existing open course covers this chain end to end. This course reorganizes the public materials of 11 top university courses (UPenn, Stanford, CMU, MIT, ETH/UZH, UCSD, Berkeley, Cornell, TUM, Columbia, Harvard) into **two learning tracks you can start immediately**, with an interactive roadmap, a unified module template, and runnable Colab labs.

## Roadmap

```
Observation → World State → Representation → Dynamics → Prediction → Planning → Action
```

## Learning Tracks

| Track | Path | For whom |
|---|---|---|
| 🧩 **Foundations** | Math / PyTorch / CV / RL groundwork, consulted on demand | Everyone |
| 🧑‍🔬 **World Model Scientist** | POMDP → SSM → RSSM → Dreamer → Planning → Video WM → Evaluation | Researchers who want to build world models |
| 👷 **Spatial & Embodied Engineer** | Geometry → Depth/Point Cloud → NeRF/3DGS → SLAM/VIO → Navigation → VLA | Engineers who want to build spatial intelligence systems |

Every module follows a unified template: Why this matters → Visual Intuition → Core Idea → Key Concepts → Core Equations → University Lecture (traced back to a specific university lecture) → Papers (Must Read / Recommended / Optional) → Hands-on → Check Your Understanding → Takeaway → Next Module.

## Labs

All 11 labs are runnable (CPU only; one-click execution on the free Colab tier):

| Lab | Content | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| [Lab 0 · Tiny World](labs/lab00_tiny_world/) | Build an environment from scratch: state/obs/action/transition/reward | CPU ~5s |
| [Lab 1 · Kalman Filter](labs/lab01_kalman_filter/) | Hand-written KF predict/update + uncertainty visualization | CPU ~3s |
| [Lab 2 · Latent Dynamics](labs/lab02_latent_dynamics/) | image→encoder→dynamics→decoder, rollout and error accumulation | CPU ~1min |
| [Lab 3 · Tiny RSSM](labs/lab03_tiny_rssm/) | deterministic h + stochastic z, prior/posterior/KL, imagination rollout | CPU ~3min |
| [Lab 4 · MPC / CEM Planning](labs/lab04_mpc_cem_planning/) | Planning with a learned model: candidate trajectories, receding horizon | CPU ~15s |
| [Lab 5 · NeRF / 3DGS](labs/lab05_nerf_gaussian_splatting/) | Hand-written tiny NeRF: rays→sampling→volume rendering→novel view | CPU ~3.5min |
| [Lab 6 · Dynamic 4D Worlds](labs/lab06_dynamic_4d_worlds/) | (x,y,z,t): ICP motion estimation, temporal interpolation, future prediction | CPU ~10s |
| [Lab 7 · Video World Model](labs/lab07_video_world_model/) | ConvGRU video prediction, 1/5/10-step degradation | CPU ~2min |
| [Lab 8 · Navigation World Model](labs/lab08_navigation_world_model/) | Partially observable navigation: Reactive vs Memory vs World-Model | CPU ~30s |
| [Lab 9 · World Model + Policy](labs/lab09_world_model_policy/) | Tiny Dreamer: training actor-critic in imagination | CPU ~45s |
| [Lab 10 · OOD / Drift Evaluation](labs/lab10_ood_drift_evaluation/) | ID/Mild/Strong OOD + Failure Gallery | CPU ~2.5min |

Every lab's README carries an **Open in Colab** badge. The notebooks for Labs 0–2 are in English; Labs 3–10 ship an English notebook (`notebook_en.ipynb`) alongside the Chinese original, and the English site links to it. Lab status is maintained centrally in [`labs/manifest.json`](labs/manifest.json). For the final project see [capstone/](capstone/) (Build Your Own World Model).

## University Sources

Every knowledge point in the course modules is traced back to a university lecture. Full survey (index, comparison, public availability, and link status of the 11 courses):

- [COURSE_INDEX.md](COURSE_INDEX.md) · [COURSE_COMPARISON.md](COURSE_COMPARISON.md) · [MATERIAL_STATUS.md](MATERIAL_STATUS.md) · [LICENSES.md](LICENSES.md)
- Per-course materials: `courses/<course_id>/` (UPenn CIS 6280, Stanford CS231A, CMU 16-825, MIT VNAV, ETH/UZH VAMR, UCSD, Berkeley, Cornell, TUM, Columbia, Harvard)
- Course-system and topic analysis: `synthesis/`
